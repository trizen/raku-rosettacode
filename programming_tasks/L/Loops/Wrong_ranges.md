# [Loops/Wrong ranges][1]





It would be odd to call ANY of these sequences "wrong" in Raku. Raku specifically has built in capability of working with infinite sequences. Just because a sequence is infinite, doesn't mean you can't define it, work with it or use values from it. Sure, if you try to reify the whole thing you may be waiting a while, but there is nothing preventing you from using a portion of it.



Raku sequence definitions *specifically* allow "ending points" that may never occur in the sequence. Since that is the case, you don't even really **need** to specify a stop value. You can just say stop at "whatever". Whatever is spelled "**\***" in Raku.



There is additional syntax you can add to stop at the nearest value, last value previous or first value successor to the "stop value" (Note I didn't say less than or greater than the stop value since the sequence can be ascending, descending or non-monotonic).



Also note: The iterator function for the sequence is literally a function. It is any expression that produces a value. These sequences all use simple arithmatic increments but that is not a limitation of the sequence operator.

```perl
# Given sequence definitions
#   start  stop  inc.   Comment
for   -2,    2,    1, # Normal
      -2,    2,    0, # Zero increment
      -2,    2,   -1, # Increments away from stop value
      -2,    2,   10, # First increment is beyond stop value
       2,   -2,    1, # Start more than stop: positive increment
       2,    2,    1, # Start equal stop: positive increment
       2,    2,   -1, # Start equal stop: negative increment
       2,    2,    0, # Start equal stop: zero increment
       0,    0,    0, # Start equal stop equal zero: zero increment

# Additional "problematic" sequences
       1,  Inf,    3, # Endpoint literally at infinity
       0,    π,  τ/8, # Floating point numbers
     1.4,    *, -7.1  # Whatever

  -> $start, $stop, $inc {
    my $seq = flat ($start, *+$inc … $stop);
    printf "Start: %3s, Stop: %3s, Increment: %3s | ", $start, $stop.Str, $inc;
    # only show up to the first 15 elements of possibly infinite sequences
    put $seq[^15].grep: +*.defined
}

# For that matter the start and end values don't need to be numeric either. Both
# or either can be a function, list, or other object. Really anything that a
# "successor" function can be defined for and produces a value.
say "\nDemonstration of some other specialized sequence operator functionality:";
# Start with a list, iterate by multiplying the previous 3 terms together
# and end with a term defined by a function.
put 1, -.5, 2.sqrt, * × * × * … *.abs < 1e-2;

# Start with an array, iterate by rotating, end when 0 is in the last place.
say [0,1,2,3,4,5], *.rotate(-1).Array … !*.tail;

# Iterate strings backwards.
put 'xp' … 'xf';
```
