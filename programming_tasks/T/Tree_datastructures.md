# [Tree datastructures][1]





Code golf is a entertaining passtime, even if it isn't appropriate for this site. To a large extent, I agree with [Hout](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/User:Hout), I am not really on board with mocking anybody, especially espousing it as an official RosettaCode position. So, feel free to mark this incorrect.

Sort of vague as to what we are trying to accomplish here. If we are just
trying to transform from one format to another, probably easiest to just
perform string manipulations.

If, on the other hand, we want perform more complex transformations; better to
load it into a native data structure which will then allow us to manipulate it
however we like.
