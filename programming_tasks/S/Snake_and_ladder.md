# [Snake and ladder][1]





Snakes and ladders is entirely chance based, so human interaction is not really required. This version allows up to one human player against any number of computer players and asks for input... but doesn't really *need* or even *use* it. I didn't bother to implement a graphical interface.

```perl
        # board layout
my %snl =  4, 14,  9, 31, 17,  7, 20, 38, 28, 84, 40, 59, 51, 67, 54, 34,
          62, 19, 63, 81, 64, 60, 71, 91, 87, 24, 93, 73, 95, 75, 99, 78;

my @players = 1, 1, 1; # three players, starting on square 1
my $human = 1;         # player 1 is human. set to 0 for all computer players

loop {
    for ^@players -> $player {
        turn(@players[$player], $player + 1);
    }
    say '';
}

sub turn ($square is rw, $player) {
    if $player == $human {
        prompt "You are on square $square. Hit enter to roll the die.";
    }
    my $roll = (1..6).roll;
    my $turn = $square + $roll;
    printf "Player $player on square %2d rolls a $roll", $square;
    if $turn > 100 {
        say " but cannot move. Next players turn.";
        return $square;
    }
    if %snl{$turn} {
        $square = %snl{$turn};
        if $turn > $square {
            say ". Oops! Landed on a snake. Slither down to $square."
        } else {
            say ". Yay! Landed on a ladder. Climb up to $square."
        }
    } else {
        $square = $turn;
        say " and moves to square $square";
    }
    say "Player $player wins!" and exit if $square == 100;
    return $square;
}
```
