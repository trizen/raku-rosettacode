# [Sum of squares][1]



```perl
say [+] map * ** 2, (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9);
```


If this expression seems puzzling, note that `* ** 2` is equivalent to `{$^x ** 2}`â€” the leftmost asterisk is not the multiplication operator but the `Whatever` star, which specifies currying behavior.
Another convenient way to distribute the exponentiation is via the cross metaoperator, which
as a list infix is looser than comma in precedence but tighter than the reduction list operator:

```perl
say [+] <3 1 4 1 5 9> X** 2
```
