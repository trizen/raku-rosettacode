# [Most frequent k chars distance][1]





My initial impressions of this task are registered on the discussion page under "Prank Page?".



The "most frequent k characters" hashing function is straightforward enough to implement. The distance function is incomprehensible though. The description doesn't match the pseudo-code and neither of them match the examples. I'm not going to bother trying to figure it out unless there is some possible value.



Maybe I am too hasty though. Lets give it a try. Implement a MFKC routine and run an assortment of words through it to get a feel for how it hashes different words.

```perl
# Fairly straightforward implementation, actually returns a list of pairs
# which can be joined to make a string or manipulated further.

sub mfkh ($string, \K = 2) {
    my %h;
    $string.comb.kv.map: { %h{$^v}[1] //= $^k; %h{$^v}[0]++ };
    %h.sort( { -$_.value[0], $_.value[1] } ).head(K).map( { $_.key => $_.value[0] } );
}

# lets try running 150 or so words from unixdic.txt through it to see
# how many unique hash values it comes up with.

One... Nope, I was right, it *is* pretty much worthless.
