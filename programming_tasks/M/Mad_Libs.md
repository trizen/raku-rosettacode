# [Mad Libs][1]





Some explanation: `S:g[...] = ...` is a global substitution that returns its result.  `%` is an anonymous state variable in which we cache any results of a prompt using the `//=` operator, which assigns only if the left side is undefined.  `slurp` reads an entire file from STDIN or as named in the argument list.

```perl
print S:g[ '<' (.*?) '>' ] =Â %.{$0} //= prompt "$0? " given slurp;
```


Sample run:


```
$ madlibs walk
name? Phydeaux
He or She? She
noun? flea
Phydeaux went for a walk in the park. She
found a flea. Phydeaux decided to take it home.
```
