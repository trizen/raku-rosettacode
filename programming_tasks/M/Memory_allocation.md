# [Memory allocation][1]





Like Perl 5, Raku is intended to run largely stackless, so all allocations are really on the heap, including activation records.  Allocations are managed automatically.  It is easy enough to allocate a memory buffer of a particular size however, if you really need it:

```perl
my $buffer = Buf.new(0 xx 1024);
```
