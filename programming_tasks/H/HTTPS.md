# [HTTPS][1]





There are several modules that provide HTTPS capability. WWW and HTTP::UserAgent are probably the most popular right now, but others exist.

```perl
use WWW;
say get 'https://sourceforge.net/';
```


or

```perl
use HTTP::UserAgent;
say HTTP::UserAgent.new.get('https://sourceforge.net/').content;
```
