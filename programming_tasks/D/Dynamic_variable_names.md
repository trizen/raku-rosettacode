# [Dynamic variable names][1]





You can [interpolate strings as variable names](https://docs.raku.org/language/packages#Interpolating_into_names):

```perl
our $our-var = 'The our var';
my  $my-var  = 'The my var';

my $name  = prompt 'Variable name: ';
my $value = $::('name'); # use the right sigil, etc

put qq/Var ($name) starts with value ｢$value｣/;

$::('name') = 137;

put qq/Var ($name) ends with value ｢{$::('name')}｣/;
```
