# [Continued fraction/Arithmetic/G(matrix ng, continued fraction n1, continued fraction n2)][1]





The NG2 object can work with infinitely long continued fractions, it does lazy evaluation. By default, it is limited to returning the first 30 terms. Pass in a limit value if you want something other than default.

```perl
class NG2 {
    has ( $!a12, $!a1, $!a2, $!a, $!b12, $!b1, $!b2, $!b );
 
    # Public methods
    method operator($!a12, $!a1, $!a2, $!a, $!b12, $!b1, $!b2, $!b ) { self }
 
    method apply(@cf1, @cf2, :$limit = 30) {
        my @cfs = [@cf1], [@cf2];
