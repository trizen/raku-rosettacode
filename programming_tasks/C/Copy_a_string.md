# [Copy a string][1]





There is no special handling needed to copy a string; just assign it to a new variable:

```perl
my $original = 'Hello.';
my $copy = $original;
say $copy;            # prints "Hello."
$copy = 'Goodbye.';
say $copy;            # prints "Goodbye."
say $original;        # prints "Hello."
```


You can also bind a new variable to an existing one so that each refers to, and can modify the same string.

```perl
my $original = 'Hello.';
my $boundÂ := $original;
say $bound;           # prints "Hello."
$bound = 'Goodbye.';
say $bound;           # prints "Goodbye."
say $original;        # prints "Goodbye."
```
