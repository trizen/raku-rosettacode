# [Pick random element][1]





In a nutshell, picking an element from a list 
is implemented with a method conveniently called "pick":

```perl
say (1, 2, 3).pick;
```


There are various ways of doing something similar, though.  
Raku has actually two methods (with associated functional forms) 
to return random elements depending on whether you are doing selection 
with or without replacement.



Selection with replacement: (roll of a die)

```perl
say (1..6).roll;          # return 1 random value in the range 1 through 6
say (1..6).roll(3);       # return a list of 3 random values in the range 1 through 6
say (1..6).roll(*)[^100]; # return first 100 values from a lazy infinite list of random values in the range 1 through 6
```


Selection without replacement: (pick a card from a deck)

```perl
# define the deck
my @deck = <2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 J Q K A> X~ <♠ ♣ ♥ ♦>;
say @deck.pick;    # Pick a card
say @deck.pick(5); # Draw 5
say @deck.pick(*); # Get a shuffled deck
```


Or you can always use the normal `rand` built-in 
to generate a subscript (which automatically truncates any fractional part):

```perl
@array[@array * rand]
```


However, the `pick` and `roll` methods (not to be confused 
with the pick-and-roll method in basketball) are more general 
insofar as they may be used on any enumerable type:

```perl
say Bool.pick;  # returns either True or False
```
