# [Van Eck sequence][1]


There is not **a** Van Eck sequence, rather a series of related sequences that differ in their starting value. This task is nominally for the sequence starting with the value 0. This Raku implementation will handle any integer starting value.



Specifically handles:



among others.



Implemented as lazy, extendable lists.

```perl
sub n-van-ecks ($init) {
    $init, -> $i, {
        state %v;
        state $k;
        $k++;
        my $t  = %v{$i}.defined ?? $k - %v{$i} !! 0;
        %v{$i} = $k;
        $t
    } ... *
}

> -> $seq, $start {

    my @seq = n-van-ecks($start);

    # The task
    put qq:to/END/

    Van Eck sequence OEIS:$seq; with the first term: $start
            First 10 terms: {@seq[^10]}
    Terms 991 through 1000: {@seq[990..999]}
    END
}
```
