How you set the address of a variable (or any other object) is outside the purview of Raku, but the language supports pluggable object representations, and any given representation scheme could conceivably allow an existing address to be treated as an object candidate where that makes sense.  Memory-mapped structs are not unreasonable and are likely to be supported on VMs that allow it.
