# [Append numbers at same position in strings][1]

Not really seeing why we need to show the result twice but that's what the requirement is... ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯ (I find myself making that gesture often in response to Calmosofts tasks.)

```perl
say [[Z~] [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18], [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]] xx 2;
```

#### Output:
```
([11019 21120 31221 41322 51423 61524 71625 81726 91827] [11019 21120 31221 41322 51423 61524 71625 81726 91827])
```
